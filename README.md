PrimeSieve
==========

Sieve of Eratosthenes

Assumptions
That you have java and maven installed.
This code has only one external dependancy apache commons lang.
This solution uses java integer which can have a maximum value of 2,147,483,647 to calculate primes for higher values the code will need to be adapted appropriately.

Note
You will need to have enough memory to calculate the prime number limit you are trying to calculate for otherwise the code prints out an error message if it runs out of memory.

I chose to use Java for the solution since am more familiar with the language.
